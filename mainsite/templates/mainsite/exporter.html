            glTF Exporter add-in for Revit exports your project to popular
            3D glTF format https://www.khronos.org/gltf/. glTF is universal
             file format for transferring 3D assets which almost every 3D
              software can handle. With glTF Exporter it has never been
              easier to get a Revit project in gltf format. Get it from the
                &nbsp<a href="#">Autodesk App Store</a> or ask for a special
                quote sending us an email.

          <p>
            The add-in is compatible with Revit 2018 or later. Open any 3D
            view, run the command and choose settings (link to Settings
            Explained section) for export. The output folder will appear
            immediately after the export process ends - you can preview the
            model in standard Windows 10 viewer by double clicking gltf file.
            Once you have the gltf file you can send it to your client, share
            on the internet, preview in many gltf viewers or import into your
            software development project - use it any way you like.
